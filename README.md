# Resume Match

**Match your resume to the job—before you apply.**

Resume Match is a U.S.-focused SaaS that helps job seekers understand how well their resume aligns with specific job descriptions. Upload your resume PDF, paste a job description, and get an instant analysis: match score, missing keywords, ATS risk flags, stronger bullet rewrites, and a tailored summary.

## What It Does

Resume Match analyzes your resume against a job description and returns:

- **Match Score**: Overall alignment percentage with job requirements
- **Missing Keywords**: Specific terms from the job description not found in your resume
- **Missing Skills**: Required skills that aren't present in your resume
- **ATS Risk Flags**: Formatting and structure issues that could cause parsing problems
- **Weak Bullets → Rewritten**: Improved versions of existing resume bullets (no fabrication)
- **Tailored Summary**: Job-specific summary highlighting your most relevant experience

## Who It's For

U.S. job seekers in:
- Software engineering
- Product management
- Data & analytics
- Design

Works best when you have a specific job description to match against.

## How It Works

1. **Upload your resume** (PDF format)
2. **Paste the job description**
3. **Get your report** in seconds with actionable insights

The analysis uses structured AI to extract requirements, compare against your resume, and provide specific, actionable feedback. We never invent achievements or add skills you don't have—everything is grounded in your actual resume content.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: Neon Postgres
- **Storage**: Vercel Blob
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout
- **Analytics**: PostHog (optional)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, OpenTelemetry
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-5-mini (default), GPT-5 (premium/fallback)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (required)
- Neon Postgres database (optional, for full functionality)
- Stripe account (optional, for payment testing)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd resume-match
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and set at least:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

For full MVP functionality, also configure:

```bash
# Stripe (for payments)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PRICE_SCAN=price_xxx   # one-time $2 per scan
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database (Neon Postgres)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require

# Analytics (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=ph_xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com
```

4. **Set up the database** (if using Neon)

- Create a Neon project at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
- Run `schema.sql` in the Neon SQL editor
- Copy the connection string to `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`

5. **Run the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

## CI/CD

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

### What CI Does

On every pull request and push to `main`, the CI workflow automatically:

1. **Installs dependencies** - Uses `npm ci` for fast, reliable installs
2. **Runs linter** - Checks code quality with ESLint
3. **Runs typecheck** - Validates TypeScript types
4. **Builds the application** - Ensures the Next.js app builds successfully

### CI Requirements

The CI workflow runs without requiring any secrets or external services. The build step uses default/empty values for optional environment variables (Sentry, app URL) to ensure builds complete successfully.

### GitHub Secrets (Optional)

For enhanced CI functionality, you can optionally configure these secrets in GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - App URL for build-time configuration (defaults to `http://localhost:3000` if not set)
- `SENTRY_ORG` - Sentry organization (optional, for source maps)
- `SENTRY_PROJECT` - Sentry project (optional, for source maps)

**Note**: These secrets are optional. CI will run successfully without them.

### Local Validation

Before pushing, you can run the same checks locally:

```bash
npm run lint      # Check code quality
npm run typecheck # Check TypeScript types
npm run build     # Verify production build
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the repository in Vercel
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL` (if using Neon)
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRICE_SCAN`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (your Vercel deployment URL)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` (if using PostHog)
4. Configure Stripe webhook:
   - Point webhook URL to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Use the webhook secret in `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
